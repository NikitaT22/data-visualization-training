Overview
=========
The data visualization module will touch upon various topics (listed below). However, the only tools that will be covered in detail are basic data visualizations using **R** and **Tableau Public**. 

If time permits (and if everyone's interested), we could cover a few advanced tools as well.

**Tools**

- R - ggplot / ggvis / htmlwidgets / ggmap / shiny
- [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/)
- Python - matplotlib
- [Raw](http://raw.densitydesign.org/)
- [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/)
- [Infogram](https://infogr.am/) / [Visual.ly](http://visual.ly/) (for infographics)

    + Chart.js
    + Dygraphs / leaflet
