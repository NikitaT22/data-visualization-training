Getting Started
===============
Please follow these steps to install necessary software before the session:

Setting up R
------------

- Download and install R_
- Download and install RStudio_
- Open RStudio, and in the console (at the bottom left of the screen), copy and paste the following snippet of code, and press enter. This should download and install all the required packages:

.. highlight:: R

::

	install.packages(c('dplyr','ggplot2','ggvis'))

.. tip:: 

	There are tons of resources to learn R online, but my favourite is Datacamp_. Note that knowledge of R is **not** a pre-requisite; we will walk through each line of code at the session.

.. _R: https://cran.r-project.org/

Tableau Public
--------------

- Download and install `Tableau Public`_. You may be asked to sign up with your email address.

.. tip:: 

	If you're interested in starting out before the session with Tableau, just open it up and play around with it. If you want more structure, here are some `YouTube tutorials`_ I found.
